--------------------TO-DO--------------------
1. Finish all mvp functionality
    - finish lifecycle of an order (we can create and view the cart, not remove or pay)
    - admin dashboard
2. Add in responsive client-side visual feedback
    - password requirements popup if not complex enough
    - signup email already exists
    - login incorrect password warning
    - adding to cart animation so you can tell when the supabase function is done
    - more?
3. More responsive feedback for viewing an item in cart that's been removed from the menu

--------------------PROBLEMS--------------------
1. We're doing the customers table manually --> after a user creates an account or we make them
    an anonymous one, we update the customers table with a new row by hand. This is one in 
    middleware.ts and signup. It would be better to do this automatically but I'm not sure it's 
    an issue as long as removing a user from user table also removes the customer (which it does)
2. No clue how the revalidateTag() calls are working... but they are :)
